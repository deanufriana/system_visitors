# Visitor System

the visit system is an application for registering when going to a place to minimize crowds during this pandemic.

[![Visitory System][product-screenshot]](https://photos.app.goo.gl/VdiTdBsasZu6MrvBA)

here are some of the features available:

* Visitor registration with visit limit to reduce crowds
* There are statistics on how many visitors will come for the next 5 days
* Visitors will get a QR code which will be submitted to the admin
* The admin can scan the QR Code and make sure he's on the list to attend that day
* admin can see all visitors who will attend

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
